## What is GitHub?

- GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses Git, a distributed version control system, at its core
- **Core pillars**:
  - Copilot
  - Collaboration
  - Productivity
  - Security
  - Scale

## Repository

- Contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history.

## Gists

- Similarly to repositories, gists are a simplified way to share code snippets with others.

## Wikis

- Every repository on GitHub.com comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki
- You can use a wiki to provide additional documentation

## Components of the GitHub flow

### What are **branches**?

- Is a safe place to experiment with new features or fixes

### What are **commits**?

- Is a change to one or more files on a branch
- Every time a commit is created, it's assigned a unique ID and tracked, along with the time and contributor

- The primary states for a file in a Git repository are:

  - **Untracked**
  - **Tracked**
    - **Unmodified**
    - **Modified**
    - **Staged**
    - **Committed**

### What is **pull request**?

- Is the mechanism used to signal that the commits from one branch are ready to be merged into another branch

### Steps through the GibHub flow (cycle)

1. Creating a branch (from the main branch)
2. Make your changes
3. Create a pull request
4. Review and implement feedback from collaborators
5. Get pull request approved and merge into main branch
6. Delete branch created on step 1

## Collaborative platform

### Issues

- Were created to track ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub
- Issues can be created in various ways

### Discussions

- Are for conversations that need to be accessible to everyone and aren't related to code

## Platform management

### Notifications and subscriptions

### GitHub Pages
