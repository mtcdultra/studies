## Identify where you can help

- Open-source software can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone

### Familiarize yourself with the project

- Most projects will have these documents at the top level of the repository:

  - LICENSE
  - README
  - CONTRIBUTING
  - CODE_OF_CONDUCT

- A good way to familiarize yourself with the community is by reading through some of these communication channels:
  - **Issue tracker**: Where folks discuss issues and tasks related to the project. To find the issues in GitHub, you can go to the main page of the repository on GitHub and add /issues to the end of the URL, for example: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues.
  - **Pull request**: Where folks discuss and review changes to the project. You can find it in GitHub by adding pulls to the project's URL, for example, https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pulls.
  - **Chat channels and forums**: Some projects use chat channels, such as Slack, Gitter, and IRC, or forums like Discourse for conversations and discussions

### Identify tasks to work on

- A good way to find beginner-friendly issues to help with is by visiting the project's /contribute URL, for example: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/contribute.

## Contribute to an open-source repository

1. Communicate your intent to maintainers
   - Look at **Assignees** section to check if someone is already working on the issue
2. Create a pull request (PR) on a GitHub repository
   - To create a pull request, need to **fork** the repository (by default, you don't have write access to the original repository)
   - Pass the status checks
3. Ask for guidance or reviews on PR
