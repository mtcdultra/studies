### Understand responsible AI

#### 6 Principals of responsible AI

- **Fairness**
  - Bias can affect results
  - Azure Machine Learning includes the capability to interpret models and quantify the extent to which each feature of the data influences the model's prediction.
  - The model should predict whether the loan should be approved or denied without bias
- **Reliability and safety**
  - Errors may cause ham
  - AI-based software application development must be subjected to rigorous testing and deployment management processes to ensure that they work as expected before release.
  - Unreliability in these kinds of systems can result in substantial risk to human life.
- **Privacy and security**
  - Data could be exposed
  - AI systems should be secure and respect privacy.
- **Inclusiveness**
  - Solutions may not work for everyone
  - AI should bring benefits to all parts of society, regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or other factors.
- **Transparency**
  - User must trust a complex system
  - Users should be made fully aware of the purpose of the system, how it works, and what limitations may be expected.
- **Accountability**
  - Who's liable for AI-driven decisions?
  - Designers and developers of AI-based solutions should work within a framework of governance and organizational principles that ensure the solution meets ethical and legal standards that are clearly defined.

## 2. Fundamentals of machine learning

- Machine learning has its origins in statistics and mathematical modeling of data. The fundamental idea of machine learning is to use data from past observations to predict unknown outcomes or values.
- A machine learning model is a software application that encapsulates a **function** to calculate an output value based on one or more input values. The process of defining that function is known as **training**. After the function has been defined, you can use it to predict new values in a process called **inferencing**.
- Exemple:
  - In the ice cream sales scenario, our goal is to train a model that can predict the number of ice cream sales based on the weather. The weather measurements for the day (temperature, rainfall, windspeed, and so on) would be the features (x), and the number of ice creams sold on each day would be the label (y).
- Steps:
  1. Training data
  2. Algorithm
  3. Result of the algorithm (y = f(x))
  4. Model can be used for inferencing (y^)

### Types of machine learning

- **Supervised**
  - **Regression (number)**
    - Evaluation metrics
      - MAE (mean absolute error)
      - MSE (mean squared error)
      - RMSE (root mean squared error)
      - R^2 (coefficient of determination)
  - **Classification (categorization or class)**
    - Binary classification (is or isn't / true or false / true or false ...)
      - Evaluation metrics
        - Confusion matrix
        - Accuracy
        - Recall
        - Precision
        - F1-score
        - AUC (area under the curve)
    - Multiclass classification
- **Unsupervised**
  - **Clustering**
    - Evaluation metrics
      - Average distance to cluster center
      - Average distance to other center
      - Maximum distance to cluster center
      - Silhouette

### Deep learning

- Deep learning is an advanced form of machine learning that tries to emulate the way the human brain learns. The key to deep learning is the creation of an artificial neural network that simulates electrochemical activity in biological neurons by using mathematical functions.
- Each neuron is a function that operates on an input value (x) and a weight (w). The function is wrapped in an activation function that determines whether to pass the output on.
- The **weights** (which are initially assigned randomly) in a neural network are central to how it calculates predicted values for labels. During the training process, the model learns the weights that will result in the most accurate predictions.
- A loss function is used to compare the predicted ŷ values to the known y values and aggregate the difference (which is known as the loss).
- The changes to the weights are backpropagated to the layers in the network, replacing the previously used values.
- The process is repeated over multiple iterations (known as epochs) until the loss is minimized and the model predicts acceptably accurately.

### Azure Machine Learning

- Is a cloud service for training, deploying, and managing machine learning models.
- Azure Machine Learning provides the following features and capabilities to support machine learning workloads:
  - Centralized storage and management of datasets for model training and evaluation.

## 4. Fundamentals of computer vision

#### Machine learning for computer vision

- The goal of computer vision is often to extract meaning, or at least actionable insights, from images; which requires the creation of machine learning models that are trained to recognize features based on large volumes of existing images.
- **Convolutional neural networks (CNN)**
  - One of the most common machine learning model architectures for computer vision
  - CNNs use filters to extract numeric feature maps from images, and then feed the feature values into a deep learning model to generate a label prediction
- **Transformers**
  - Another type of neural network architecture
  - Transformers work by processing huge volumes of data, and encoding language tokens (representing individual words or phrases) as vector-based embeddings (arrays of numeric values)
- **Multi-modal models (Microsoft Florence)**
  - In which the model is trained using a large volume of captioned images, with no fixed labels.
  - An image encoder extracts features from images based on pixel values and combines them with text embeddings created by a language encoder.

#### Azure AI Vision

- Microsoft's Azure AI Vision service provides prebuilt and customizable computer vision models that are based on the Florence foundation model and provide various powerful capabilities.
- To use Azure AI Vision, you need to create a resource for it in your Azure subscription.

## 5. Fundamentals of Facial Recognition

    - **Azure AI services**: A general resource that includes Azure AI Face along with many other Azure AI services such as Azure AI Content Safety, Azure AI Language, and others.
      - Use this resource type if you plan to use multiple Azure AI services and want to simplify administration and development.

## 6. Fundamentals of Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

- OCR is the foundation of processing text in images and uses machine learning models that are trained to recognize individual shapes as letters, numerals, punctuation, or other elements of text.

#### Azure AI Vision's OCR Engine

- **Azure AI Vision's Read API** is the OCR engine that powers text extraction from images, PDFs, and TIFF files.
- Calling the Read API returns results arranged into the following hierarchy:
  - **Pages** - One for each page of text, including information about the page size and orientation.
  - **Lines** - The lines of text on a page.
  - **Words** - The words in a line of text, including the bounding box coordinates and text itself.

## 7. Fundamentals of Text Analysis with the Language Service

  - These questions and answers can be:
    - Generated from an existing FAQ document or web page.
    - Entered and edited manually.

## 9. Fundamentals of conversational language understanding

### Describe conversational language understanding

- To work with conversational language understanding, you need to take into account three core concepts:
  - **Utterances**
    - Is an example of something a user might say, and which your application must interpret "turn on the light
  - **Entities**
    - Is an item to which an utterance refers "light"
  - **Intents**
    - Represents the purpose, or goal, expressed in a user's utterance. "turn on"
- **Authoring a model** involves **defining entities, intents, and utterances**.
- To use conversational language capabilities in Azure, you need a resource in your Azure subscription.
- You can use the following types of resource:
  - Azure AI Language
  - Azure AI services

## 10. Fundamentals of Azure AI Speech

- Speech recognition takes the spoken word and converts it into data that can be processed - often by transcribing it into text.

### Speech on Azure

## 12. Fundamentals of Knowledge Mining and Azure AI Search

- Knowledge mining is the term used to describe solutions that involve extracting information from large volumes of often unstructured data
- One of these knowledge mining solutions is **Azure AI Search**, a cloud search service that has tools for building user-managed indexes

### What is Azure AI Search?

- **Azure AI Search** provides the infrastructure and tools to create search solutions that extract data from various structured, semi-structured, and non-structured documents
- It's a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution
- Azure AI Search comes with the following features:
  - Data from any source
  - Full text search and analysis
  - AI powered search
  - Multi-lingual
  - Geo-enabled
  - Configurable user experience

### Identify elements of a search solution

- The solution starts with a data source that contains the data artifacts you want to search
- The data format that Azure AI Search supports is JSON
- You can attach a skillset that applies a sequence of AI skills to enrich the data, making it more searchable

### Use a skillset to define an enrichment pipeline

- AI enrichment refers to embedded image and natural language processing in a pipeline that extracts text and information from content that can't otherwise be indexed for full text search.
- Built-in skills fall into these categories:
  - Natural language processing
    - uses a pre-trained model to detect important phrases based on term placement, linguistic rules, proximity to other terms, and how unusual the term is within the source data
  - Image processing skills
    - creates text representations of image content, making it searchable using the query capabilities of Azure AI Search

### Understand indexes

- An Azure AI Search index can be thought of as a container of searchable documents
- **Indexer**
  - In order to index the documents in Azure Storage, they need to be exported from their original file type to JSON. In order to export data in any format to JSON, and load it into an index, we use an **indexer**.
  - To create search documents, you can either generate JSON documents with application code or you can use **Azure's indexer** to export incoming documents into JSON.
  - JSON documents into an index with two approaches:
    - Push method
    - Pull method
- Making changes to an index
  - **You have to drop and recreate** indexes if you need to make changes to field definitions
  - An approach to updating an index without affecting your users is to create a new index under a different name. You can use the same indexer and data source. After importing data, you can switch your app to use the new index.

### Query data in an Azure AI Search index

- After we build the index, we can perform queries
- Azure AI Search queries can be submitted as an HTTP or REST API request, with the response coming back as JSON
- Azure AI Search supports two types of syntax:
  - Simple
    - overs all of the common query scenario
  - Full Lucene
    - Is useful for advanced scenarios

## 13. Fundamentals of Generative AI

### What is generative AI?

- Generative AI describes a category of capabilities within AI that create original content
- Generative AI applications take in natural language input, and return appropriate responses in a variety of formats such as natural language, images, or code.

### Large language models (LLMs)

- Generative AI applications are powered by large language models (LLMs), which are a specialized type of machine learning model that you can use to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including:
  - Determining sentiment or otherwise classifying natural language text.
  - Summarizing text.
  - Comparing multiple text sources for semantic similarity.
  - Generating new natural language.
- LLMs are based on the transformer architecture
- Transformer model architecture consists of two components, or blocks:
  - An encoder block that creates semantic representations of the training vocabulary.
  - A decoder block that generates new language sequences.
- The implementations of the architecture vary – for example:
  - The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model developed by Google to support their search engine uses only the encoder block
  - The Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model developed by OpenAI uses only the decoder block.
- Key elements of LLMs:
  - Tokenization
  - Embeddings
  - Attention

### Azure OpenAI

- Azure OpenAI Service is Microsoft's cloud solution for deploying, customizing, and hosting large language models
- Azure OpenAI supports many models that can serve different needs. These models include:
  - GPT-4 models
  - GPT-3.5 models
  - Embedding models
  - DALL-E models

## 14. Fundamentals of Azure OpenAI Service

- Capabilities of OpenAI models:
  - Generating natural language
  - Generating code
  - Generating images

### Azure OpenAI Service

- Is a result of the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI.
- The service combines Azure's enterprise-grade capabilities with OpenAI's generative AI model capabilities.
- Azure OpenAI is available for Azure users and consists of four components:
  - Pre-trained generative AI models
  - Customization capabilities; the ability to fine-tune AI models with your own data
  - Built-in tools to detect and mitigate harmful use cases so users can implement AI responsibly
  - Enterprise-grade security with role-based access control (RBAC) and private networks
- Azure OpenAI Service may be more beneficial for use-cases that require highly customized generative models, or for exploratory research

#### How to use Azure OpenAI

- You need to apply for access to Azure OpenAI
- Once granted access, you can use the service by creating an Azure OpenAI resource, like you would for other Azure services
- Once the resource is created, you can use the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or the web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.
- **OpenAI's natural language capabilities**
  - Natural language learning models are trained on words or chunks of characters known as tokens.
  - These tokens are mapped into vectors for a machine learning model to use for training
- **OpenAI code generation capabilities**
- **OpenAI's image generation capabilities**

## 15. Fundamentals of Responsible Generative AI

### Plan a responsible generative AI solution

- The Microsoft guidance for responsible generative AI is designed to be practical and actionable.
- It defines a four stage process to develop and implement a plan for responsible AI when using generative models:

  - **Identify potential harms** that are relevant to your planned solution.
    - There are four steps in this stage:
      - Identify potential harms
      - Prioritize identified harms
      - Test and verify the prioritized harms
      - Document and share the verified harms
  - **Measure the presence of these harms** in the outputs generated by your solution.
    - A generalized approach to measuring a system for potential harms consists of three steps:
      - Prepare a diverse selection of input prompts that are likely to result in each potential harm that you have documented for the system.
      - Submit the prompts to the system and retrieve the generated output.
      - Apply pre-defined criteria to evaluate the output and categorize it according to the level of potential harm it contains.
  - **Mitigate the harms** at multiple layers in your solution to minimize their presence and impact, and ensure transparent communication about potential risks to users.

    - It involves a layered approach as shown here:
      - Model
      - Safety system
      - Metaprompt and grounding
      - User experience

  - **Operate the solution responsibly** by defining and following a deployment and operational readiness plan.
    - Common compliance reviews include:
      - Legal
      - Privacy
      - Security
      - Accessibility

## 16. Prepare to develop AI solutions on Azure

### Define artificial intelligence

- AI is software that exhibits one or more human-like capabilities, as shown in the following:
  - Visual perception
  - Text analysis and conversation
  - Speech
  - Decision-making

### Understand AI-related terms

#### Data Science

- Is a discipline that focuses:
  - On the processing and analysis of data
  - Applying statistical techniques to uncover and visualize relationships and patterns in the data
  - Defining experimental models that help explore those patterns.

#### Machine Learning

- Is a subset of data science that deals with the training and validation of predictive models.
- Typically, a data scientist prepares the data and then uses it to train a model based on an algorithm that exploits the relationships between the features in the data to predict values for unknown labels.

#### Artificial Intelligence

- Artificial intelligence usually (but not always) builds on machine learning to create software that emulates one or more characteristics of human intelligence.

### Understand considerations for AI Engineers

#### Model training and inferencing

- The training process analyzes the data and determines relationships between the features in the data (the data values that will generally be present in new observations) and the label (the value that the model is being trained to predict)
- After the model has been trained, you can submit new data that includes known feature values and have the model predict the most likely label. Using the model to make predictions is referred to as inferencing.

#### Probability and confidence scores

- The predictions made by machine learning models are based on probability
- Predictions have an associated confidence score that reflects the probability on which the prediction is being made.

#### Responsible AI and ethics

- It's important for software engineers to consider the impact of their software on users, and society in general; including ethical considerations about its use.

### Understand considerations for responsible AI

- Fairness
- Reliability and safety
- Privacy and security
- Inclusiveness
- Transparency
- Accountability

### Understand capabilities of Azure Machine Learning

- Microsoft Azure provides the **Azure Machine Learning service** - a cloud-based platform for running experiments at scale to train predictive models from data, and publish the trained models as services.
- Azure Machine Learning provides the following features and capabilities:
  - Automated machine learning (AutoML)
  - Azure Machine Learning designer
  - Data and compute management
  - Pipelines

### Understand capabilities of Azure AI Services

- Azure AI Services are set of individual services that you can use as building blocks to compose sophisticated, intelligent applications
- Prebuilt AI capabilities across multiple categories:
  - Azure OpenAI Service
  - Azure AI Vision
  - Azure AI Language
  - Azure AI Speech
  - Azure AI Document Intelligence
  - Azure AI Search
  - Azure AI Content Safety
  - Azure AI Document Intelligence

## 17. Create and consume Azure AI services

- Azure AI services provide REST application programming interfaces (APIs) that client applications can use to consume services.
- AI services includes a wide range of individual services across multiple categories
  - Language
    - Azure AI Language
    - Azure AI Translator
  - Speech
    - Azure AI Speech
  - Vision
    - Azure AI Computer Vision
    - Azure AI Custom Vision
    - Azure AI Face
  - Decision
    - Azure AI Anomaly Detector
    - Azure AI Content Moderator
    - Azure AI Personalizer
- **Options for Azure resources**
  - **Multi-service resource**
    - You can provision an AI services resource that supports multiple different AI services
    - This approach enables you to manage a single set of access credentials to consume multiple services at a single endpoint, and with a single point of billing for usage of all services
  - **Single-service resource**
    - Each AI service can be provisioned individually
    - This approach enables you to use separate endpoints for each service and to manage access credentials for each service independently.

### Identify endpoints and keys

- When you provision an Azure AI services service resource in your Azure subscription, you are defining an endpoint through which the service can be consumed by an application.
- To consume the service through the endpoint, applications require the following information:
  - **The endpoint URI**
    - This is the HTTP address at which the REST interface for the service can be accessed
  - **A subscription key**
    - Access to the endpoint is restricted based on a subscription key
  - **The resource location**

## 18. Secure Azure AI services

### Consider authentication

- By default, access to Azure AI services resources is restricted by using subscription keys

### Regenerate keys

- You can regenerate keys using the Azure portal, or using the Azure CLI
- Each AI service is provided with two keys, enabling you to regenerate keys without service interruption

### Protect keys with Azure Key Vault

- **Azure Key Vault** is an Azure service in which you can securely store secrets
- Administrators can assign a security principal to an application (in which case it is known as a service principal) to define a managed identity for the application.

### Token-based authentication

- When using the REST interface, some AI services support (or even require) token-based authentication.

### Microsoft Entra ID authentication

- Enable you to grant access to specific service principals or managed identities for apps and services running in Azure
- There are different ways you can authenticate against Azure AI services using Microsoft Entra ID, including:
  - Authenticate using service principals
  - Authenticate using managed identities

### Implement network security

- By default, Azure AI services are accessible from all networks
- Some individual AI services resources (such as Azure AI Face service, Azure AI Vision, and others) can be configured to restrict access to specific network addresses - either public Internet addresses or addresses on virtual networks

## 19. Monitor Azure AI services

- **Plan cost for AI services**
  - Before deploying a solution that depends on AI services, you can estimate costs by using the **Azure Pricing Calculator**
- **Alert rules**
  - You use alert rules to configure notifications and alerts for your resources based on events or metric thresholds
  - These alerts will ensure that the correct team knows when a problem arises
- **Metrics**
  - Azure Monitor collects metrics for Azure resources at regular intervals so that you can track indicators of resource utilization, health, and performance
- **Diagnostic logging**
  - Diagnostic logging enables you to capture rich operational data for an Azure AI services resource, which can be used to analyze service usage and troubleshoot problems

## 20. Deploy Azure AI services in containers

- Containers enable you to host Azure AI services either on-premises or in Azure
- Deploying Azure AI services in a container on-premises will also decrease the latency between the service and your local data, which can improve performance

### Use Azure AI services containers

- There are container images for Azure AI services in the Microsoft Container Registry that you can use to deploy a containerized service that encapsulates an individual Azure AI services service API
- To deploy and use an Azure AI services container, the following three activities must occur:
  - The container image for the specific Azure AI services API you want to use is downloaded and deployed to a container host, such as a local Docker server, an Azure Container Instance (ACI), or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
  - Client applications submit data to the endpoint provided by the containerized service, and retrieve results just as they would from an Azure AI services cloud resource in Azure.
  - Periodically, usage metrics for the containerized service are sent to an Azure AI services resource in Azure in order to calculate billing for the service.

#### Azure AI services container images

- Language containers
- Speech containers
- Vision containers

#### Azure AI services container configuration

When you deploy an Azure AI services container image to a host, you must specify three settings:

- ApiKey
- Billing
- Eula

## 21. Classify images with Azure AI Custom Vision

- Some potential uses for image classification include:
  - Product identification
  - Disaster investigation
  - Medical diagnosis

### Understand classification

- You can use a machine learning classification technique to predict which category, or class, something belongs to
- Classification machine learning models use a set of inputs, which we call **features**, to calculate a probability score for each possible class and predict a **label** that indicates the most likely class that an object belongs to.

### Azure's Custom Vision service

- Common techniques used to train image classification models have been encapsulated into the **Azure AI Custom Vision service**, part of the Azure AI services
- Creating an image classification solution with Azure AI Custom Vision consists of two main tasks
  - Use existing images to train the model
  - Publish the model so that client applications can use it to generate predictions.

## 22. Detect objects in images with Azure AI Custom Vision

### What is object detection?

- Object detection model returns the following information:
  - The class of each object identified in the image
  - The probability score of the object classification
  - The coordinates of a bounding box for each object

### Azure resources for Azure AI Custom Vision

- Creating an object detection solution with Azure AI Custom Vision consists of three main tasks:
  - Upload and tag images
  - Train the model
  - Publish the trained model so client applications can use it to generate predictions

## 23. Translate text and speech with Azure AI services

### Get started with translation in Azure

- Microsoft provides Azure AI services that support translation. Specifically, you can use the following services:
  - The **Azure AI Translator** service, which supports text-to-text translation.
    - When using Azure AI Translator, you can specify one from language with multiple to languages, enabling you to simultaneously translate a source document into multiple (more than 60) languages
  - The **Azure AI Speech** service, which enables speech to text and speech-to-speech translation
    - Includes the following APIs:
      - Speech to text
      - Text to speech
      - Speech translation
