## 1 - Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe cloud concepts

Azure Fundamentals is a series of three learning paths that familiarize you with Azure and its many services and features.

- Cloud computing platform
- Provides a wealth of cloud-based services like remote storage, database hosting, and centralized account management
- Offers new capabilities like artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) focused services
- Supports running fully virtualized computers managing your custom software solution

**Support plans**

- Basic (no support) / 10Gb storage
- Developer (support only business hours by email)
- Standard (full support) / 50Gb storage
- Professional Direct (full support)

### 1.1 Describe cloud computing

Concepts od responsibility, different cloud models and explore the unique pricing method for the cloud.

#### What is cloud computing

Is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Include:

- Virtual machines
- Storage
- Databases
- Networking
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Machine learning (ML)
- Artificial intelligence (AI).

Shared responsibility model: responsibilities get shared between the cloud provider and the consumer.

- Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the _responsibility of the cloud provider_.
- The consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud, also responsible for access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it.

##### Cloud service types:

- **Infrastructure as a service** (**IaaS**)
  - IaaS places the **most responsibility on the consumer**, with the cloud provider being responsible for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity.
- **Platform as a service** (**PaaS**)
  - PaaS, being a middle ground between IaaS and SaaS, rests somewhere in the middle and evenly distributes **responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer**.
- **Software as a service** (**SaaS**)
  - SaaS places **most of the responsibility with the cloud provider**.

##### Cloud models:

Define the deployment type of cloud resources

- **Private cloud**
  - Used by single entity
  - Provides much greater control for the company and its IT department
  - Comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment
  - May be hosted from your on site datacenter. It may also be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite, potentially even by a third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company
- **Public cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP...)**
  - Is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider
  - Anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources
  - The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds
- **Hybrid cloud**
  - Can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources.
- **Multi-cloud**
  - Used multiple public cloud providers
  - In a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

**_Azure Arc_**: set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment.
**_Azure VMware Solution_**: lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

##### Consumption-based model

When comparing IT infrastructure models, there are two types of expenses to consider. **Capital expenditure** (CapEx) and **operational expenditure** (OpEx).

- **Examples CapEx**: new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle
- **Examples OpEx**: spending money on services or products over time. Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services

**Benefits of consumption-based model**:

- No upfront costs.
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
- The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

Cloud pricing models (Is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone elseâ€™s datacenter.)

- Pay only for the cloud services you use:
  - Plan and manage your operating costs.
  - Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
  - Scale as your business needs change.

### 1.2 Describe the benefits of using cloud services

- **High Availability**
- **Scalability**
- **Reliability**
- **Predictability**
- **Security**
- **Governance**
- **Elasticity**
- **Manageability**

#### Benefits of high availability and scalability

- When building or deploying a cloud application, two of the biggest considerations are uptime (or **availability**) and the ability to handle demand (or **scale**).
- **SLA** (service-level agreement): agreement between a service provider and costumer (service time).
- **Availability** focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.
- **Scalability** refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand.
  - Scaling generally comes in two varieties: vertical and horizontal.
    - _Vertical_ scaling is focused on increasing or decreasing the **capabilities of resources**.
      - Add more CPUs or RAM
    - _Horizontal_ scaling is adding or subtracting the **number of resources**
      - Add additional virtual machines or containers

#### Benefits of reliability and predictability

- **Reliability (fail)** is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.
- **Predictability** in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability.
  - **Performance** predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability.
  - **Cost** predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. Can even use tools like the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** or **Pricing Calculator** to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.

#### Benefits of security and governance

- **Governance**
  - Cloud features support governance and compliance.
  - Cloud-based auditing helps flag any resource thatâ€™s out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies.
- **Security**
  - Cloud providers are typically well suited to handle things like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, making your network more robust and secure.
  - If you want **patches and maintenance taken care of automatically**, **PaaS and SaaS** are best
  - If you want **maximum control of security**, **IaaS** is best

#### Benefits of manageability

There are two types of manageability for cloud computing:

- Management of the cloud (managing your cloud resources)
  - Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
  - Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
  - Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
  - Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so youâ€™re aware of performance in real time.
- Management in the cloud (how youâ€™re able to manage your cloud environment and resources)
  - Through a web portal.
  - Using a command line interface.
  - Using APIs.
  - Using PowerShell.

### 1.3 Describe cloud service types

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- The most flexible category of cloud service
- With IaaS, youâ€™re essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that hardware is up to you.
- The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure and its access to the internet. Youâ€™re responsible for installation and configuration, patching and updates, and security.
- Common scenarios:
  - Lift-and-shift migration: Youâ€™re setting up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and then simply moving the things running on-prem to running on the IaaS infrastructure.
  - Testing and development: You have established configurations for development and test environments that you need to rapidly replicate. You can start up or shut down the different environments rapidly with an IaaS structure, while maintaining complete control.

#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- Is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (software as a service)
- The cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet. They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution.
- In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases.
- Common scenarios:
  - Development framework: PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications. Similar to the way you create an Excel macro, PaaS lets developers create applications using built-in software components. Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that developers must do.
  - Analytics or business intelligence: Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data, finding insights and patterns and predicting outcomes to improve forecasting, product design decisions, investment returns, and other business decisions.

#### Software as a Service (SaaS)

- With SaaS, youâ€™re essentially renting or using a fully developed application. Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software are all common examples of a SaaS implementation.
- SaaS is the model that places the most responsibility with the cloud provider and the least responsibility with the user.
- Common scenarios:
  - Email and messaging.
  - Business productivity applications.
  - Finance and expense tracking.

| Service | Caracteristcs                                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| IaaS    | More flexible / Configure and manager hardware               |
| PasS    | Application development / Platform manager by cloud provider |
| SaaS    | Software as subscribe / Pay by user                          |

## 2 - Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe Azure architecture and services

### 2.1 Describe the core architectural components of Azure

#### Azure accounts

![alt text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/wwl-azure/describe-core-architectural-components-of-azure/media/account-scope-levels-9ceb3abd.png)

#### Azure physical infrastructure

- **Core architectural componentes**:
  - **Physical infrastructure**
    - **Datacenters**
      - Are grouped into Azure Regions or Azure Availability Zones that are designed to help you achieve resiliency and reliability for your business-critical workloads
    - **Regions**
      - Is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network.
    - **Availability Zones**
      - Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region
      - Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking
      - An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary
      - Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases.
      - Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:
        - **Zonal services:** You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses)
        - **Zone-redundant services:** The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).
        - **Non-regional services:** Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages.
    - **Region pairs**
      - Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away.
    - **Sovereign regions**
      - Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure.
      - ou may need to use a sovereign region for compliance or legal purposes.
  - **Management infrastructure**
    - **Resource** is the basic building block of Azure (VM, BD, virtual network...)
      - Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource
      - Resource --> Resource Group (container of resources)
    - **Azure subscriptions**
      - An Azure subscription links to an Azure account, which is an identity in Microsoft Entra ID or in a directory that Microsoft Entra ID trusts.
      - You can use Azure subscriptions to define boundaries around Azure products, services, and resources.
      - There are two types of subscription boundaries that you can use:
        - _Billing boundary_: This subscription type determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure. You can create multiple subscriptions for different types of billing requirements. Azure generates separate billing reports and invoices for each subscription so that you can organize and manage costs.
        - _Access control boundary_: Azure applies access-management policies at the subscription level, and you can create separate subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures. An example is that within a business, you have different departments to which you apply distinct Azure subscription policies. This billing model allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision with specific subscriptions.
    - **Azure management groups**
      - Provide a level of scope above subscriptions
      - You organize subscriptions into containers called management groups and apply governance conditions to the management groups.

### 2.2 Describe Azure compute and networking services

#### Describe Azure Virtual Machine

- Can create and use VMs in the cloud
- As an IaaS offering, you still need to configure, update, and maintain the software that runs on the VM.
- **Scale VMs in Azure** ( you can group VMs together to provide high availability, scalability, and redundancy)
  - **Virtual machine scale sets**
    - Let you create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs.
    - You can build large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads.
  - **Virtual machine availability sets**
    - Availability sets are designed to ensure that VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, preventing you from losing all your VMs with a single network or power failure.
    - Availability sets do this by grouping VMs in two ways: _update domain_ and _fault domain_.

#### Describe Azure virtual desktop

- Is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud.
- It enables you to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location.

#### Describe Azure containers

- If you want to run multiple instances of an application on a single host machine, containers are an excellent choice.
- You can run multiple containers on a single physical or virtual host.
- **Azure Container Instances**
  - Allow you to upload your containers and then the service will run the containers for you.
  - Are a platform as a service (PaaS)
- **Azure Container Apps**
  - Container Apps have extra benefits such as the ability to incorporate load balancing and scaling
- **Azure Kubernetes Service**
  - AKS is a container orchestration service.
  - An orchestration service manages the lifecycle of containers.

#### Describe Azure functions (serverless)

- **Is an event-driven, serverless compute** option that doesnâ€™t require maintaining virtual machines or containers
- With **Azure Functions**, an event wakes the function, alleviating the need to keep resources provisioned when there are no events
- Azure Functions runs your code when it's triggered and automatically deallocates resources when the function is finished.
- Benefits of Azure Functions:
  - No infrastructure management
  - ScalabilityOnly pay for what you use
- Functions are a key component of serverless computing
- Functions can be:
  - Stateless (default)
    - Restarted every time they respond to an event.
  - Stateful (called Durable Functions)
    - A context is passed through the function to track prior activity

#### Describe application hosting options

- If host an application on Azure, you might initially turn to a **virtual machine** (VM) or **containers**
- But there are other hosting options than can be use, is **Azure App Service**
  - **App Service** enables you to build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure
  - Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. It supports multiple languages, including .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. It also supports both Windows and Linux environments.
- Types of app services:
  - Web apps
  - API apps
  - WebJobs
  - Mobile apps

#### Describe Azure virtual networking (VNet)

- Provide the following key networking capabilities:
  - Isolation and segmentation
  - Internet communications
  - Communicate between Azure resources
  - Communicate with on-premises resources
  - Route network traffic
  - Filter network traffic
  - Connect virtual networks
- Communicate between Azure resources
  - Virtual networks
  - Service endpoints
- Communicate with on-premises resources
  - Point-to-site virtual private network
  - Site-to-site virtual private network
  - Azure ExpressRoute

#### Describe Azure virtual private networks (VPN)

- **Azure VPN Gateway** instances are deployed in a dedicated subnet of the virtual network and enable the following connectivity:
  - Connect on-premises datacenters to virtual networks through a site-to-site connection.
  - Connect individual devices to virtual networks through a point-to-site connection.
  - Connect virtual networks to other virtual networks through a network-to-network connection.
- You can deploy only one VPN gateway in each virtual network. However, you can use one gateway to connect to multiple locations, which includes other virtual networks or on-premises datacenters.
- **High-availability scenarios** (There are a few ways to maximize the resiliency of your VPN gateway)
  - Active/active
  - Active/standby
  - ExpressRoute failover
  - Zone-redundant gateways

#### Describe Azure ExpressRoute

- Azure ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection, with the help of a connectivity provider. This connection is called an **ExpressRoute Circuit**.
- Connectivity can be from:
  - An any-to-any (IP VPN) network
  - A point-to-point Ethernet network
  - A virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider at a colocation facility.
- ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public Internet.
- **ExpressRoute supports four models** that you can use to connect your on-premises network to the Microsoft cloud:
  - CloudExchange colocation
  - Point-to-point Ethernet connection
  - Any-to-any connection
  - Directly from ExpressRoute sites
- With ExpressRoute, your data doesn't travel over the public internet, so it's not exposed to the potential risks associated with internet communications.
- ExpressRoute is a private connection from your on-premises infrastructure to your Azure infrastructure.

#### Describe Azure DNS

- Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure.
- Benefits of Azure DNS
  - Reliability and performance
  - Security
  - Ease of Use
  - Customizable virtual networks
  - Alias records

### 2.3 Describe Azure storage services

#### Describe Azure storage accounts

- Storage account provides a unique namespace for your **Azure Storage** data that's accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS
- Azure Storage always stores multiple copies of your data
- List of redundancy options:
  - Locally redundant storage (**LRS**)
  - Geo-redundant storage (**GRS**)
  - Read-access geo-redundant storage (**RA-GRS**)
  - Zone-redundant storage (**ZRS**)
  - Geo-zone-redundant storage (**GZRS**)
  - Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (**RA-GZRS**)
- Storage account endpoints
  - Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only.
  - Your storage account name must be unique within Azure.

#### Describe Azure storage redundancy

- **Redundancy in the primary region (LRS & ZRS)**
  - _Data in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region_.
  - Offers two options for how your data is replicated in the primary region>
    - **Locally redundant storage (LRS)**
      - Replicates your data three times within a single data center in the primary region.
      - Provides at least 11 nines of durability (99.999999999%) of objects over a given year.
      - LRS is the lowest-cost redundancy option and offers the least durability compared to other options.
    - **Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)**
      - Replicates your Azure Storage data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region.
      - Provides at least 12 nines of durability (99.9999999999%) of objects over a given year.
      - Recommended for restricting replication of data within a country or region to meet data governance requirements.
  - **Redundancy in a secondary region (GRS & GZRS)**
    - For applications requiring high durability, you can choose to additionally copy the data in your storage account to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region.
    - By default, data in the secondary region isn't available for read or write access unless there's a failover to the secondary region.
    - - Offers two options for copying your data to a secondary region:
      - **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)**
        - Similar to LRS
        - GRS copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS.
        - GRS offers durability for Azure Storage data objects of at least 16 nines (99.99999999999999%) over a given year.
      - **Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)**
        - Similar to ZRS
        - GZRS is designed to provide at least 16 nines (99.99999999999999%) of durability of objects over a given year.
    - The interval between the most recent writes to the primary region and the last write to the secondary region is known as the **recovery point objective (RPO)**.
    - The RPO indicates the point in time to which data can be recovered.
    - Azure Storage typically has an **RPO of less than 15 minutes**, although there's currently no SLA on how long it takes to replicate data to the secondary region.
    - For read access to the secondary region, enable (if you enable read access to the secondary region, your data is always available, even when the primary region is running optimally):
      - **Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)** or
      - **Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)**.

#### Describe Azure storage services

- The Azure Storage platform includes the following data services:
  - **Azure Blobs**: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data. Also includes support for big data analytics through Data Lake Storage Gen2.
    - Is unstructured, meaning that there are no restrictions on the kinds of data it can hold
    - Can store massive amounts of data, such as text or binary data.
    - Blobs aren't limited to common file formats
  - **Azure Files**: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
    - Azure File storage offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (**SMB**) or Network File System (NFS) protocols.
  - **Azure Queues**: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.
    - Azure Queue storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages.
    - Queues are commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously.
  - **Azure Disks**: Block-level storage volumes for Azure VMs.
    - Conceptually, theyâ€™re the same as a physical disk, but theyâ€™re virtualized â€“ offering greater resiliency and availability than a physical disk.
  - **Azure Tables**: NoSQL table option for structured, non-relational data.

- Scopes include:
  - A management group (a collection of multiple subscriptions).
  - A single subscription.
  - A resource group.
  - A single resource.
- **Azure RBAC is hierarchical**, in that when you grant access at a parent scope, those permissions are inherited by all child scopes.

#### Describe zero trust model

- Zero Trust is a security model that assumes the worst case scenario and protects resources with that expectation.
- Zero Trust assumes breach at the outset, and then verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network.
- Is based on these guiding principles:
  - **Verify explicitly** - Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
  - **Use least privilege access** - Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
  - **Assume breach** - Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption. Use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.

#### Describe defense-in-depth
